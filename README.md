# Hey, I'm Luiz Otávio! 👋

I'm an **ADS (Systems Analysis and Development)** student who actually enjoys getting my hands dirty with code. I like building things that work, from solid back-end logic to clean front-end interfaces.

### 🛠️ What I've been working with:

### 📂 Real Projects:

* **🍷 Wine E-commerce:** A full-blown store built with **React** and **Laravel**. I used **PostgreSQL** to handle the data and focused on making the whole flow feel smooth.
  
* **💸 Expense Tracker:** A simple, fast financial tool using **Node.js** and **React**. No fluff, just performance.

* **🎮 Just for Fun:** I've also built some games and landing pages using vanilla JS to make sure my fundamentals are solid before jumping into frameworks.

### 🌱 Current Focus:
Learning more about **Software Engineering** and looking for my first real-world **Internship**.
